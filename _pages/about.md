I am a fourth-year computer science undergrad at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), supervised by Professor [Jiawei Han](https://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). I am also collaborating with the [Matsuo Iwasawa Lab](https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

My current research interests include:
- augmenting LLMs with external knowledge sources; 
- turning LLMs via reinforement learning.
