Hi, this is Mark! 

I am a senior CS Undergrad at [UIUC](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), privileged to be advised by Professor [Jiawei Han](https://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). 

My current research interests include:
- Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge sources; 
- Turning LLMs/Agents via Reinforcement Learning.

Email: xie39 [AT] illinois.edu

I like singing and photography, and I'm more of a **cat** person!
